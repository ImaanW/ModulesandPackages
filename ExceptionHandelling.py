# EXCEPTION HANDELING
# dedicated code dealing with errors
# exception is represented by an object
#  derived from super class
# includes diagonostics attributes which may be rointed
# thtrowing an exception transfers control - if you can write code that stops this from happening that that's great
# the function call stack is unwound until a handler capable of handling the exception object is found
#


# EXCEPTION SYNTAX
